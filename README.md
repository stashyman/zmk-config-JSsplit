Here is my daily driver keyboard that I custom designed, made and is currently running ZMK firmware. Most of the keycaps (the uniform ones) are ones that I custom designed as well. The dongle the Snake Dongle done by Joaopedropio (https://github.com/joaopedropio/snake-dongle)

If you are not looking to use the PIM447 (Pimoroni Trackball Breakout pim447) then I have a branch that is pre trackball. This one will work with the Snake Dongle and no trackball.
